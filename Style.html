		<h3>Cast and acting :<h3> 
	<p>
	Casting includes Ajay Devgan in title role and Saif ali khan as antagonist Udaybhan Rathod. Both main leads play the role to perfection. Saif Ali Khan struggles with Rajput accent but overall his performance is praiseworthy. Also supporting cast including Sharad Kelkar as ‘Shivaji Maharaj’ and kajol as ‘Savtri’ puts forth brilliant performances. <br>
	</p>
<h3>Direction and screenplay :<h3>
	<p>
	Director Om Raut does full justice the story and the most commendable aspect of the movie is the screenplay which invests you in the movie fully. Action scenes and battle sequences in the movie are well choreographed and will keep you at edge of your seats. This movie is not so realistic and takes some cinematic liberties for presenting the story. Some action scenes seems larger than life but it is okay for the movie which is presented at this pitch. As a entertainer this movie fabulous. <br>
	</p>
<h3>Songs and background music :<h3>
	<p>In the overall impact created by the film background music of the movie takes the large share. Music of the movie created by Ajay-Atul and Sachet-Parampara is very impactful and will give you goosebumps at several moments. The songs of the movie sometimes feels unnecessary but they doesn’t affect the flow of the movie.   <br>
	</p>	
<h3>CGI and costume design:<h3>
	<p>
	The costume design of the movie is period accurate and plays the important role of transferring the audience to the era. Visual effects of the movie are just fantastic. The movie is presented at grand scale and visual team does full justice to the movie and era. The film is visual treat for the eyes. <br>
